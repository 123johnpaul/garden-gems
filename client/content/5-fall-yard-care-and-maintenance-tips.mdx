Autumn is the strategic season—the bridge between peak growth and winter dormancy. A focused fall routine conserves plant energy, improves resilience, and reduces spring workload.

## 1. Optimize Soil Before It Sleeps
Soil biology remains active after top growth slows.
- Top‑dress beds with 0.5–1 inch of screened compost.
- Add shredded leaf mold to improve fungal networks.
- Avoid deep tilling; preserve soil structure.

## 2. Smart Pruning (What *Not* to Touch)
Skip heavy pruning of spring bloomers (lilac, forsythia) or you’ll remove next year’s buds.
- Remove diseased, dead, or crossing branches only.
- Cut back spent perennials prone to mildew (e.g., monarda) to improve airflow.
- Leave structurally attractive seed heads (echinacea, grasses) for winter interest + wildlife.

## 3. Lawn & Turf Strategy
- Aerate compacted zones if infiltration is poor.
- Overseed thin cool‑season lawns while soil temps remain above 50°F.
- Apply a slow‑release, organic, low‑nitrogen fertilizer to build root reserves.
- Mulch‑mow leaves → natural micronutrient cycling.

## 4. Watering & Root Protection
Roots keep absorbing moisture until ground freeze.
- Deep water evergreens during dry spells.
- Install / refresh 2–3 inch mulch layer (pull back from trunks).
- Relocate tender container plants before first hard frost.

## 5. Pest & Disease Prevention
- Sanitize tools between cuts when dealing with fungal issues.
- Remove mummified fruits & infected leaves (trash them, not compost).
- Encourage predators: keep some hollow stems for overwintering insects.

## Bonus: Plant for Spring Now
Fall is prime for planting trees, shrubs, garlic, and spring bulbs—the soil is warm and root establishment is efficient.

| Planting Task | Fall Benefit | Spring Payoff |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Bulb layering | Efficient bed planning | Sequential blooms |
| Garlic sets | Strong root network | Larger cloves |
| Native shrubs | Less transplant shock | Earlier flowering |

## Quick Checklist
- [ ] Compost top‑dress complete
- [ ] Selective pruning only
- [ ] Overseeding done
- [ ] Mulch refreshed
- [ ] Tools cleaned & stored

> “Fall maintenance is quiet momentum—your spring garden begins now.”

Close the season intentionally, and your landscape coasts into winter with strength.
